# TezBox Chrome Plugin
You can download the TezBox chrome plugin here: https://github.com/tezbox/tezbox-chrome-plugin/raw/master/src.crx

### Future Development
We still need to implement the following:
1) Signing of operations/transactions (to be able to send Tez and delegate)
2) Setup hooks to allow DAPP developers to integrate directly with their websites/dapps
